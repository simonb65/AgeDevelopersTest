# AgeDevelopersTest
Thanks for the opportunity to submit this code.

The solution has 2 "sections"
- A "quick answer" project that could be used to investigate data and explore
- A more "production" quality code with unit tests.

Some notes:
- I have had time to complete full unit test coverage but I hope tests show what capabilities
- The main report code could be in a seperate project so it can be used by multiple consumers, for simplicity I added it to the console app
